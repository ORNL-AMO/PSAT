<h1>What Is Specific Speed?</h1>
<p>
Specific speed is a numerical representation of the impeller shape.  When appropriate units are used, it is a dimensionless quantity.  However, standard industry practice is to use common engineering units that do not resolve to a dimensionless quantity.
</p>
<p>
The standard U.S. (metric) units used to calculate specific speed are:
</p>
<p>
Rotational speed: rpm (rpm)
Flow rate: gpm (m^3/hr)
Head: ft (m)
</p>
<p>
It is also standard practice to simply eliminate the gravitational constant term. The specific speed equation is to be applied to only one condition, namely the best efficiency point (BEP)
</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>
BEP flow rate = 5000 gpm (1135.6 m^3/hr)
BEP head = 120 feet (36.6 m)
Rotating speed = 1780 rpm

<p>
    U.S. Specific speed = 3472; metric specific speed = 4033
</p>
<p>
Most centrifugal pumps in common industrial applications will have specific speed values in U.S. (metric) units of  between 500 (581) and 7000 (8132).  Pump impellers toward the lower end of the range have a pronounced radial flow, while impellers toward the upper end of the range approach an axial flow profile.
